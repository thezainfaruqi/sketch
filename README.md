### **Etch-a-Sketch (Web-Based Pixel Drawing App)**  

**Etch-a-Sketch** project built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It allows users to draw on a dynamically generated grid by hovering their mouse over the squares. Users can also customize the grid size using a button prompt.  

---

## **Features**  
**Dynamic Grid Creation** – The grid is generated dynamically using JavaScript.  
**Flexbox Layout** – No CSS Grid is used; only **Flexbox** ensures proper alignment.  
**Hover Effect** – When the mouse hovers over a grid square, it changes color.  
**Custom Grid Size** – Users can set a new grid size (up to **100x100**) through a prompt.  
**Responsive & Scalable** – The grid adapts to fit the **960px width**, keeping square proportions.  

---

## **How It Works**  
1. Open the webpage, and a **16x16 default grid** appears.  
2. Hovering over squares **changes their color**, leaving a "pixelated trail."  
3. Click the **"Enter Grid Value"** button to change the grid size.  
4. Enter a number (between 1 and 100) to create a new grid of that size.  
5. The existing grid is **cleared and replaced** with the new one.
